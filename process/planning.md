# Planning and communication

## Standup

Every day at 9:30am we meet for a 10-15 minute discussion of project progress. We answer these questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you planning to do today?
- Is anything blocking you?

It’s not a status meeting — we don’t need alllllll the details. And it’s not the time to do argue, demo, or solve problems. Log issues or questions and move on. Go person to person, one at a time.

## Status meeting

Every Monday we discuss the status of each of our projects in a bit more detail, project by project. Because we typically work on multiple projects at once, our weekly status meeting helps us plan out when to most effectively work on what.

- What are we collectively working on this week?
- What’s coming up in the next 10 days?
- Are there any fires to put out?

This is also a good time to share studio news, celebrate high points or grumble about challenges, and to show work or share inspiration.

## Calendar

Every three weeks or so we block out four to six weeks of work at a high level, project by project, on the big calendar we keep on the whiteboard. Meetings and such go into the shared Google calendar.

## Quarterly progress reports

We meet quarterly on a [Rumors Friday](./operations/studio.md) to discuss progress toward internal projects and goals.

## Email

Email can take up a lot of time. We use it to communicate with clients, rarely internally. Unless it is an emergency, we respond to client communication within a day or two — not instantaneously.

## Slack

We use Slack as an internal communication tool to chat about projects, studio news, and other stuff.

Star client channels to add them to an alpha-sorted list at the top of the sidebar. Other channels, like #music and #plants, live in a stack below.

At the onset of a project we'll set up a channel for that client. (Or un-archive a channel if we’ve worked with them previously.) Here are some of the ways we use client channels in Slack:

- Talk specifically about project details — hash out questions, report on progress, note client communication
- Ask for help or feedback on a technical detail
- Post links to relevant documentation, notes, something you want someone to review
- Note small updates or quick changes to the project (then file in GitHub issues)
