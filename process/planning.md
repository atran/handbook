# Planning and communication

## Meetings

We use Skype, Google Hangouts, or Slack calls for remote meetings. It depends on the client. Meetings should be under an hour and should have a purpose and an agenda, even a simple one. Send a calendar invite for meetings.

## Standup

Every day at 9:30am we meet for a 10-15 minute discussion of project progress. We answer these questions:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you planning to do today?
- Is anything blocking you?

It’s not a status meeting — we don’t need alllllll the details. And it’s not the time to do argue, demo, or solve problems. Log issues or questions and move on. Go person to person, one at a time.

## Status meeting

Every Monday we discuss the status of each of our projects in a bit more detail, project by project. Because we typically work on multiple projects at once, our weekly status meeting helps us plan out when to most effectively work on what.

- What are we collectively working on this week?
- What’s coming up in the next 10 days?
- Are there any fires to put out?

This is also a good time to share studio news, celebrate high points or grumble about challenges, and to show work or share inspiration.

## Calendar

We use Google Calendar to mark events, meetings, major milestones, closures, vacations. Every three weeks or so we block out four to six weeks of work at a high level, project by project, on the big calendar we keep on the whiteboard.

## Quarterly progress reports

We meet quarterly on a [Rumors Friday](./operations/studio.md) to discuss progress toward internal projects and goals.

## Email

Email can take up a lot of time. We use it to communicate with clients, rarely internally. Unless it is an emergency, we respond to client communication within a day or two — not instantaneously. We use Gmail.

## Slack

We use Slack as an internal communication tool to chat about projects, studio news, and other stuff.

Star client channels to add them to an alpha-sorted list at the top of the sidebar. Other channels, like #music and #plants, live in a stack below.

At the onset of a project we'll set up a channel for that client. (Or un-archive a channel if we’ve worked with them previously.) Here are some of the ways we use client channels in Slack:

- Talk specifically about project details — hash out questions, report on progress, note client communication
- Ask for help or feedback on a technical detail
- Post links to relevant documentation, notes, something you want someone to review
- Note small updates or quick changes to the project (then file in GitHub issues)

## Documents and files

We use Dropbox Paper for most project planning, documentation, notes, working files, and sometimes presentations. Most of our work takes place in *Projects*, which is organized by client name. Within each client folder is a folder for each project or product. Preface all your files with *YYYYMMDD*, so we know what’s most recent.

For things like proposals, briefs, and other client-facing deliverable documents, we use Pages and export to PDF for clients.

We use Dropbox to store files. Administrative stuff is in the *Rumors Admin* folder. Client work is in the *Rumors Team* folder, organized by client name. Within each client folder is a folder for each project or product. Within that:

- **Assets.** Stuff the client gives us.
- **Deliverables.** Stuff we give the client. (Some deliverables may be in Paper.)
- **Design.** Working design files, if they’re not in Figma.

Add folders within as needed to keep things organized. Preface files with *YYYYMMDD*, so we know what’s most recent.

## Logins and passwords

We use 1Password to manage project passwords. 

## Time-tracking

Track your time on every project, whether or not it’s billable. We use Harvest; we’re planning to switch to Airtable in 2019.
