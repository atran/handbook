# Overview

Rumors is a small studio with five full-time designers. We work collaboratively, so although our roles are specific, they are also fluid. We are generalists.

We strive to be honest, communicative, and easy to work with.  We work in dialog with clients as equal participants. Our methodology is context-specific â€” a publication redesign requires a different approach than a digital strategy.

Every client and project is different, though most of the time our process touches on these phases.
