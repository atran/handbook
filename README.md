# Handbook

**⚠️ WIP ⚠️**

Welcome to the Rumors handbook, ongoing documentation of our operations and process. Developed collaboratively, updated frequently, maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit).

## Operations
- [Studio culture and operational details](./operations/studio.md)
- Hiring and employee onboarding
- [Salary and benefits](./operations/benefits.md)
- [Tools we use](./operations/tools.md)
- [Performance reviews](./operations/performance-reviews.md)
- [Yearly retrofuturespective](./operations/retrofuturespective.md)
- [Code of conduct](./operations/code-of-conduct.md)

## Process
We strive to be honest, communicative, and easy to work with. We value collaboration, and work in dialog with clients as equal participants. Our methodology is context-specific — a publication redesign requires a different approach than a digital strategy. Every client and project is different, though most of the time our process touches on these phases.
