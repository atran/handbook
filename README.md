# Handbook

**‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Welcome to the Rumors handbook, ongoing documentation of our operations and process. Developed collaboratively, updated frequently, maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit).

## Process

Rumors is a small studio with five full-time designers. We work collaboratively, so while our roles are specific, they are also fluid. We are generalists, thinkers, and writers.

We strive to be honest, communicative, and easy to work with.  We work in dialog with clients as equal participants. Our methodology is context-specific ‚Äî a publication redesign requires a different approach than a digital strategy.

Every client and project is different, though most of the time our process touches on these phases.
