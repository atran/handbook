# Handbook

**‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The Rumors handbook is an ongoing documentation of our process and operations. It is developed collaboratively, updated frequently, and maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit). Propose changes in [issues](https://github.com/rumors/handbook/issues), or open a pull request.

## Process

We use a lightweight process that yields to context. It encourages clients to perceive our worth in experience and expertise rather than in the deliverables that may be the outcome of our work.

- Overview
- [Kickoff](process/kickoff.md)
- [Research, discovery, and strategy](process/research-discovery-strategy.md)
- Design
- Development
- [Handoff](process/handoff.md)
- [Retrospective](process/retrospective.md)

## Operations

We work collaboratively, so while our roles are specific, they are also fluid. We are generalists, thinkers, and writers. We strive to work with respect, kindness, and transparency.
