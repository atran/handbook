# Hours

The studio is open Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm. Daily standup begins at 9:30am. Within business hours we offer structured flexibility, which means that you can do things like:

- Work from another location one or two days a week if that’s better for you.
- Shift your daily hours to avoid a bad commute, or break up the day into productive chunks.
- Step away from your work in micro-increments of 1-3 hours to accommodate the unexpected.

Let us know in advance if you won’t be available during business hours, and put it in the calendar. Of course, sometimes emergencies arise. Be in touch with Andy as soon as you know your schedule.

## Call-free Wednesdays

We observe call-free Wednesdays, which means that we keep Wednesdays free of client calls, video chats, and client meetings in the studio. We try to avoid internal meetings, too. That leaves us with a full midweek day for heads-down work.

## Rumors Fridays

Fridays are our “investment time,” a concept borrowed from [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/). We set aside every Friday for professional development, studio operations, planning, and culture, internal projects, and community participation. This could be anything from learning a new skill to attending a talk to planning a studio website redesign.

## Travel

You might need to travel for work once or twice a year. We’ll give you at least two weeks advance notice if we need you to be somewhere else. Rumors pays for all travel and lodging expenses, including up to $65 per diem for meals and incidentals. Save your receipts and submit them to Andy when you return.
