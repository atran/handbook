# Benefits

These are our standard benefits; your employment contract might be slightly different.

## Payday

We’ll direct deposit your pay on the last Friday of every month. Talk to Andy to set that up; until then, we’ll cut you a check.

## Health stipend

Rumors doesn’t provide health insurance coverage, but we’ll give you $280 per month to use toward health insurance premium payments. You choose your own coverage. 

## Retirement plan

After three? six? months of full-time employment, you’re eligible to enroll in the retirement plan. It’s a SIMPLE IRA, and we’ll match up to 3%.

## Professional development

We’ll cover up to $3000 of professional development expenses per year, which you can use for things like books, courses, classes, and conferences, plus related travel expenses. Submit your receipts to Andy for reimbursement.
