# Benefits

These are our standard benefits; your employment contract might be slightly different.

## Payday

We’ll direct deposit your pay on the last Friday of every month. Talk to Andy to set that up; until then, we’ll cut you a check.

## Health stipend

Rumors doesn’t provide health insurance coverage, but we’ll give you $280 per month to use toward health insurance premium payments. You choose your own coverage. 

## Retirement plan

After three? six? months of full-time employment, you’re eligible to enroll in the retirement plan. It’s a SIMPLE IRA, and we’ll match up to 3%.

## Professional development

We’ll cover up to $3000 of professional development expenses per year, which you can use for things like books, courses, classes, and conferences, plus related travel expenses. Submit your receipts to Andy for reimbursement.

## Performance reviews

Performance reviews are employee-centric assessments lead by Andy. They are not tied to hire date, but a regular ritual that takes place in December and June. Usually they involve lunch. 
As an employer, Andy will provide:

- Specific, constructive, actionable feedback on your role and project outcomes
- Support of your professional growth and self-directed initiatives
- An opportunity for peer recognition

As an employee, you’ll provide:

- A few flexible, self-determined goals that align with your practice (e.g., design, development, strategy) and overall studio goals

Your performance goals should be:

- Ambitious and maybe a little bit uncomfortable
- Convey endpoints and outcomes, not maintenance or continuance
- Tangible and unambiguous

New employees will have two opportunities to check in with Andy and set expectations and goals following the early days of their employment.

- An initial check-in after six weeks
- A performance review after three months
