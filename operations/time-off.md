# Time off

Time off is available to all employees immediately.

## Regular closures

We’re closed on these holidays:

- New Year’s Day
- Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
- Presidents’ Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Veterans Day
- Thanksgiving Day and Thanksgiving Friday
- Christmas Eve and Christmas Day

We close for the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day and the week of July 4. We’ll determine the exact closure dates the preceding quarter. We expect you to take time to vote and participate in jury duty. 

## Vacation

We expect that you’ll take at least 10 paid vacation days in a year, and up to 15, in addition to our regular closures and breaks. Vacation days don’t roll over. Request vacation from Andy at least two weeks in advance, and put it in the calendar.

## Sick days

You get 10 paid sick days per year. You can use these for physical illness, mental health, personal reasons, whatever. You don’t need a doctor’s note. Unused sick leave will not roll over year-to-year.

## Family leave

We offer 30 days of paid parental leave. In addition, you may elect to receive 12 unpaid workweeks of leave, as stipulated by [FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/) (Family Medical Leave Act). You can use this time for the birth of a child; an adoption or foster care placement; to care for a partner, child, or parent; or for a serious health condition that limits your ability to work. If something else is going on, talk to Andy.
